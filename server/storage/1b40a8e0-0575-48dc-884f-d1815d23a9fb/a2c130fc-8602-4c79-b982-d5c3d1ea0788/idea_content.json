  "title": "Silent Forge Dynamics (SFD) Housing",
  "description": "A comprehensive acoustic and vibration mitigation solution achieved through a revolutionary, double-isolated chassis design (inspired by F2). The core mechanical components are encased in a housing utilizing constrained layer damping (CLD) material, surrounded by a sealed chamber filled with a highly viscous, non-Newtonian fluid. This fluid system absorbs and dissipates impact energy and high-frequency noise internally, rather than transferring it to the foundation or the air. This significantly reduces noise pollution and operator vibration exposure (F2), allowing for installation in workshops closer to residential areas or urban centers where strict noise regulations apply.",
