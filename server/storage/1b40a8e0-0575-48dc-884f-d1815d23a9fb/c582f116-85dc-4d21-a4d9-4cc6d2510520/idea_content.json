  "title": "Entrenador 3D",
  "description": "A cross-platform service that converts the real-time performance data of elite, human instructors into highly realistic, dynamic AI agents (digital twins). When an elite coach leads a class, the system captures their movement, voice cadence, and real-time biometric feedback loop. This data instantly trains a specific AI agent model (Nexus Clone). Gyms or home users can then book this specific elite trainer’s clone for a live, interactive 3D class at any time—not a recording. The AI agent will dynamically respond to the user/group, mirroring the original coach's style but adapting to the participant's actual performance level, addressing individual needs in real-time. This creates a scalable 'sustainable' library of personalized elite coaching experiences, maximizing the reach of top trainers globally, especially within the high-traction Spanish-speaking market.",
