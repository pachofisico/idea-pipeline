  "description": "A digitized financial service product designed specifically for low-literacy segments of the 'gente del común.' This is an intangible product (a personalized micro-loan or insurance package). Its innovation lies entirely in the *intangible characteristics* (Ref: Kotler) provided: extreme simplicity, personalized naming, and guaranteed transparency. For instance, an emergency fund product is named by the user ('El Colchón de Mamá' - Mom's Mattress Fund) to connect the service to a relatable benefit/desire (Ref: docsity). The product features (terms, rates) are simplified into three visual tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold), removing complex financial jargon and building trust.",
