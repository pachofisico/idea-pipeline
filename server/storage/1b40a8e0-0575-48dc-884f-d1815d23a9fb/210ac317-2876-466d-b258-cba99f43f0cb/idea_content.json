  "title": "Hércules Digital: Field QA Auditor",
  "description": "A ruggedized, AI-powered smart hammer designed for construction and civil inspection professionals (not just modal analysts). It utilizes the robust integrated force sensor and Modal Tuning capability (Source: pcb.com) to ensure precise, noise-free input measurement. When struck against concrete, wood, or masonry, the device analyzes the resulting impact force decay signature and correlates it with an on-board database of material integrity profiles (e.g., density, curing uniformity, presence of voids). The value proposition is real-time, objective QA grading via a simple color-coded result (Green: Optimal; Yellow: Monitor; Red: Rejection), bypassing the need for complex signal analysis software. Data is geo-tagged and synced via a companion app.",
