  "description": "A premium, hands-free personal item retrieval system for smart homes and assisted living. Leveraging the 'worthiness' concept (Findings 2, 3), the system uses AI visual authentication and proprietary algorithms to verify the authorized user via specific voice commands or gesture patterns (like invoking Mjölnir). Once verified, small, necessary items (e.g., medication dispensers, reading glasses, remote controls) housed in small, magnetized pods are autonomously delivered to the user via discreet magnetic tracks or micro-drone platforms integrated into the environment. It ensures personalized access and high convenience for mobility-restricted users.",
