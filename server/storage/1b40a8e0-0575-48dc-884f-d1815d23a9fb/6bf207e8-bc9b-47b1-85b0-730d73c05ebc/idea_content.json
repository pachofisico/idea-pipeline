  "title": "Personalized Predictive Mental Wellness Platforms",
  "description": "An advanced B2B predictive platform that integrates directly with corporate tools (e.g., Google Workspace, Outlook, Slack, JIRA). It analyzes objective, non-self-reported data points such as calendar density, sequential meeting gaps, response latency in communications, and project velocity to predict organizational burnout risk 72 hours to one week in advance. The value proposition is proactive workflow rebalancing: the platform automatically suggests workload distribution changes, mandates 'focus hours' to prevent context switching, and alerts team leads to high-risk individuals *before* they report stress or exhibit performance drops. This moves mental wellness from an HR benefit to an operational productivity tool.",
